Console-Based To-Do List Application in Python
The Console-Based To-Do List Application in Python is a simple yet practical program designed to help students manage their academic tasks during the semester. The project demonstrates how fundamental programming concepts can be applied to solve everyday problems such as organizing assignments, exam preparation, and project deadlines.
The application provides a menu-driven interface where users can:
- Add new tasks dynamically.
- View all tasks with numbering for easy identification.
- Remove tasks by selecting their number.
- Exit the program gracefully when finished.
Tasks are stored in a Python list, which allows flexible addition and removal. The program uses functions to separate responsibilities, ensuring modularity and readability. A continuous loop keeps the program running until the user chooses to exit, making it interactive and user-friendly.
Error handling is implemented to manage invalid inputs, ensuring the program does not crash when users enter incorrect values. Although the current version stores tasks only in memory, the design can be extended to include features such as file storage, deadlines, priorities, and completion tracking.
